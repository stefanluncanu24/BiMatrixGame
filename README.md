# Game Theory Solver

A Python application with a Tkinter GUI to solve two-player zero-sum matrix games using linear programming.

## Features

- Input payoff matrix manually or load from a file (future feature).
- Calculates the value of the game and optimal mixed strategies for both players.
- Handles games with saddle points (pure strategies) and those requiring mixed strategies.
- Includes dominance checks to simplify the matrix.
- Visualizes the payoff matrix and optimal strategies using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Provides mathematical validation of the solution.

## Project Context

This was developed as a university project for an Operations Research course.
